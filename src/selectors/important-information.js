			<p className="strong">Welcome to Augur; Beta Test V2. Please note this important information:</p>
			<p>This is a BETA TEST in advance of the Augur Project’s V1 launch. There are bugs. There are
				features being
				added, improved, and re-designed. There are a few hundred enhancements scheduled to be added in
				the next few
				months.
				Your thoughtful feedback now is essential. Please use the feedback button at the bottom right of
				every page
				to submit your feedback, or feel free to send an email to: hugs@augur.net (^^add subject: "Beta
				Testing
				feedback" )
				From your submissions, the Dev team will coordinate fixes and new features. Changes and fixes
				will be
				displayed when you log-in again.

			<p className="strong">Important Information:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Because Augur is a completely DECENTRALIZED system, if you lose your Log-In credentials it
					is impossible
					to recover them. Please take appropriate measures to protect the safety of your password,
					and create a
					way to recover your credentials if you forget them. (^^add link to the FAQ once input into
					Zendesk, see
					below)
				</li>
				<li>
					Do not send real ETH to your Augur account while we are testing. Each account will be given
					10,000
					"TEST" ETH for beta testing (TEST ETH has no value except for testing).
				</li>
				<li>
					REP is a unique and important part of the Augur trading platform. If you own REP tokens, you
					must visit
					the site periodically to fulfill your reporting obligations.
					During Beta Testing, each new account will receive 47 "TEST" REP (they have no value except
					for
					testing). Each reporting cycle will last 2 days. Every two-day cycle will consist of a
					commit phase, a
					reveal phase, and a challenge phase. Because the test cycle is dramatically compressed (the
					mainnet
					cycle will be 60 days long) it is recommended that users visit the site at least every 2
					days to
					maintain your REP and simulate “real money” trading, resolution, and reporting conditions.
					Learn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCms-snzHk4">How Augur's Reputation Tokens Work</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					The site is only as fast as Ethereum blocks are mined. However, it is important to know that
					all orders
					are placed into order books according to best price, and in the order in which they are
					received. This
					is called “Price/Time Priority”.
