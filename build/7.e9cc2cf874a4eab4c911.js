The site is only as fast as Ethereum blocks are mined.  Augur\'s matching engine sorts order books by price, then by block number, then by transaction index.

When constructing a block, miners typically order transactions first by gasprice (highest to lowest), and then by the order received (oldest to newest).  So, Augur\'s "price/blocknumber/transaction index priority" ordering is generally equivalent to price/time priority, if there are differing gasprices within the block, the transaction index is not guaranteed to be time-ordered.
