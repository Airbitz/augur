If you own REP tokens, you must visit\n\t\t\t\t\tthe site periodically to fulfill your reporting obligations. During beta testing, each new account will\n\t\t\t\t\treceive 47 testnet REP (they have no value except for testing). Each reporting cycle will last 2 days. Every\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo-day cycle will consist of a commit phase, a reveal phase, and a challenge phase. Because the test\n\t\t\t\t\tcycle is dramatically compressed (the main net cycle will be 60 days long) it is recommended that\n\t\t\t\t\tusers visit the site at least every 2 days to maintain your REP and simulate “real money” trading,\n\t\t\t\t\tresolution, and reporting conditions.

The site is only as fast as Ethereum blocks are mined.  Augur's matching engine sorts order books by price, then by block number, then by transaction index. Within a single block, transactions are ordered by the miner who mines the block.  When constructing a block, miners typically order transactions first by gasprice (highest to lowest), and then by the order received (oldest to newest).  So, Augur's \"price/blocknumber/transaction index priority\" ordering is generally equivalent to price/time priority, if there are differing gasprices within the block, the transaction index is not guaranteed to be time-ordered.  (Presently, Augur does not attempt to adjust gasprices in response to other pending transactions, although, if desired, gasprice can be adjusted manually using the API, by changing the \"gasPrice\" field attached to every sendTransaction payload.)`}\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<h2>Technical updates:</h2>\n\t\t\t<h3>November 30, 2016</h3>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tAdded human-readable &quot;label&quot; and &quot;description&quot; fields to static API data.  Added &quot;label maker&quot; to augur-core API maker script.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe following things are now included in the auto-generated transaction display: formatted label, description, timestamp, and gas fees.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tAdded a &quot;no-relay&quot; list to the UI, which has the names of methods for which the transaction relay should not be triggered.  This will allow the old manually-constructed &quot;transactions&quot; to peacefully coexist with relay-generated transactions in the transaction display.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<h3>November 29, 2016</h3>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tAttached the initial transact payload and full Ethereum network response data objects to the txRelay callback argument in ethrpc.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tPercentage reporting on correct outcome is now only displayed for binary markets, since we do not presently have access to this information for categorical and scalar markets.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tFixed an array indexing error in getMarketInfo function on the compositeGetters contract.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tReports are now revealed in parallel (up to 5 at a time).\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tRegistered sell error codes for the shortAsk method.  This fixes the bug where a short ask order would correctly fail (due to orders being &quot;crossed&quot;), but the transactions display would incorrectly show the short ask as successful.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tRemoved deprecated callbacks from augur.js.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tFixed augur.js sendEther method to correctly include an onFailed callback.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<h3>November 28, 2016</h3>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe checkPeriod function now only looks up chain data on initial loading and when the reporting cycle phase changes.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tRemoved code related to the market data refresh timer, which is no longer used.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tAdded a generic hook for transaction callbacks to ethrpc.

Best bid/ask now represent the best prices in any block, for a given market and outcome.  (The block number restriction is no longer necessary since the crossed-orders check simply returns an error for the later-arriving order, which is not placed on the book.)\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<h3>November 25, 2016</h3>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tEvent IDs retrieved during composite lookups (getMarketInfo, batchGetMarketInfo, and/or getMarketsInfo) are now uniformly formatted.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tAdded market/event ID parser method to the static API data of several augur.js wrappers.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tCombined first and second reporting test sequences into one method.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tDefault HTTP and websocket hosted node URLs are now attached to the ethrpc (augur.rpc) object / editable by the consumer.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t<h3>November 24, 2016</h3>\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tRestructured augur.js tests: moved unit tests and integration tests to separate folders.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tUpdated UUID versions and package name in keythereum and augur.js.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tUpdated middleware Travis CI builds to only run on updates to the master branch.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tVarious fixes to augur UI unit tests.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tMerged Sprinkle&#39;s mega-PRs!
